    "\n",
    "1. Data Normalization:\n",
    "   - Uniform Scaling: Ensures all features are scaled to a similar range, preventing dominance by features with larger scales.\n",
    "   - Improved Convergence: Facilitates faster convergence in optimization algorithms by making the loss surface more symmetric.\n",
    "   - Interpretability: Easier interpretation as values are on a consistent scale, aiding in comparison and understanding of feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Standardization:\n",
    "   - Mean Centering: Transforms data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, simplifying interpretation of coefficients in linear models.\n",
    "   - Handling Different Scales: Useful when features have different scales or units, making them directly comparable.\n",
    "   - Reducing Sensitivity to Outliers: Less affected by outliers compared to normalization, leading to more robust models.\n",
    "   - Maintaining Information: Preserves relative relationships between data points without altering the distribution shape."
